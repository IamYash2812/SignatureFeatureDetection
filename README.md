# Signature Feature Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on signature feature detection using machine learning techniques. The application is built using Streamlit and requires Python dependencies listed in `req.txt`.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system
- Git installed for cloning the repository

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/IamYash2812/SignatureFeatureDetection.git
cd SignatureFeatureDetection
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```sh
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
#### On Windows:
```sh
venv\Scripts\activate
```
#### On macOS/Linux:
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r req.txt
```

## Running the Application
Once all the dependencies are installed, you can start the application using Streamlit:
```sh
streamlit run ui.py
```

This will launch the web interface for signature feature detection.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter missing dependencies, ensure you are in the virtual environment before installing.
- If `streamlit` is not recognized, try reinstalling using `pip install streamlit`.
- For any other issues, refer to the project's repository or open an issue.
